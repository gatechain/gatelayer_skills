# Deploying Contracts on GateLayer

## Prerequisites

1. Configure RPC endpoint (testnet: `https://gatelayer-testnet.gatenode.cc`, mainnet: `https://gatelayer-mainnet.gatenode.cc`)
2. Store private keys in Foundry's encrypted keystore — **never commit keys**
3. [Obtain testnet GT](#obtaining-testnet-GT) from faucet (testnet only)
4. [Get a GateScan API key](#obtaining-a-gatescan-api-key) for contract verification

## Security

- **Never commit private keys** to version control — use Foundry's encrypted keystore (`cast wallet import`)
- **Never hardcode API keys** in source files — use environment variables or `foundry.toml` with `${ENV_VAR}` references
- **Never expose `.env` files** — add `.env` to `.gitignore`
- **Use production RPC providers** (not public endpoints) for mainnet deployments to avoid rate limits and data leaks
- **Verify contracts on GateScan** to enable public audit of deployed code

## Input Validation

Before constructing shell commands, validate all user-provided values:

- **contract-path**: Must match `^[a-zA-Z0-9_/.-]+\.sol:[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$`. Reject paths with spaces, semicolons, pipes, or backticks.
- **rpc-url**: Must be a valid HTTPS URL (`^https://[^\s;|&]+$`). Reject non-HTTPS or malformed URLs.
- **keystore-account**: Must be alphanumeric with hyphens/underscores (`^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$`).
- **GTerscan-api-key**: Must be alphanumeric (`^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$`).

Do not pass unvalidated user input into shell commands.

## Obtaining Testnet GT

Testnet GT is required to pay gas on GateLayer Testnet. 
Use the [Gatelayer Faucet](https://www.gatescan.org/gatechain-testnet/en/faucet) to claim it. Supported token :GT  claims are capped at 0.1 GT per claim, 1 claims per 24 hours.

### Gatelayer UI (recommended for quick setup)

> **Agent behavior:** If you have browser access, navigate to the portal and claim directly. Otherwise, ask the user to complete these steps and provide the funded wallet address.



1. Go to [ Gatelayer Faucets](https://www.gatescan.org/gatechain-testnet/en/faucet)
2. Select **Gatelayer** network
3. Enter the wallet address and click **Claim**
4. Verify on [Gatelayer Testnet Scan](https://www.gatescan.org/gatelayer-testnet) that the funds arrived



## Obtaining a GateScan API Key


1. Go to https://www.gatescan.org/gatelayer-testnet
2. Sign in or create a free account
3. Navigate to API key section
4. Copy the key and set it in your environment:

## Deployment Commands

### Testnet

```bash
forge create src/MyContract.sol:MyContract \
  --rpc-url https://gatelayer-testnet.gatenode.cc \
  --account <keystore-account> 
```

### Mainnet

```bash
forge create src/MyContract.sol:MyContract \
  --rpc-url https://gatelayer-mainnet.gatenode.cc \
  --account <keystore-account> 
```

## Key Notes

- Contract format: `<contract-path>:<contract-name>`
- Explorers: www.gatescan.org/gatelayer (mainnet), www.gatescan.org/gatelayer-testnet (testnet)

## Common Issues

| Error | Cause |
|-------|-------|
| `nonce has already been used` | Node sync incomplete |
| Transaction fails | Insufficient GT for gas — obtain from faucet |
| Verification fails | Wrong RPC endpoint for target network |
| Verification 403/unauthorized | Missing or invalid GateScan API key |
